As your begin doing your research, your data process may change, and it is perfectly acceptable to change your data management plan to accommodate the changes in your research process. Indicate below that you understand the purpose of completing this Outline DMP template.</div>
                  <br>

                    <p>I understand the Outline DMP template is a projection of my anticipated data management planning requirements and should be updated as my project develops.</p>

                    <div class="bold">DATA CENTRES/REPOSITORIES - Once your project, dissertation or thesis is complete, it is advisable to curate and archive your completed dataset with an established data centre or repository. Check with your supervisor or funder if you are required to deposit your data in a specific repository, or declare that you will deposit the data in ZivaHub (see the Guidance section).</div>
                  <br>

                    <p>The links to the data and the output from the thesis such as predictions, generated models, etc will be stored on the UCT repository ZivaHub at the end of the thesis.</p>

                    <div class="bold">METADATA - Metadata is descriptive information that others will need to make sense of your dataset. Metadata includes things like study descriptions or abstracts, study instruments (sample collection schedules, codebooks for variables, survey instruments, etc.), subject codes, and keywords. Indicate what metadata will accompany your curated dataset.</div>
                  <br>

                    




The completed dataset will be accompanied by keywords, a short description taken from my dissertation abstract, and relevant paragraphs on the data process taken from my methods section.
